 fuck you
I'm a mess
but I'd never feel ashamed
you got a fucking problem?
baby this is who I am

I know that I'm the only one that you can ever blame
but I just won't take it on me
three weeks in a row
but we've never left the bed
you used to call me playa
used to say that I pretend
but you never really knew that I have meant what I have said
